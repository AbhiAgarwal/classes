Goal: Introduction to the assignment submission process

Instructions:
Write a program that prints a single line:
"Hello, World"
This output is case-sensitive. Also note that there must be
a newline terminator at the end of your line.
Don't forget to add and commit any source files that you add, but don't
commit binary files.
Example: If you write a new file called HelloWorld.java,
you can add it this way:
$ git add HelloWorld.java
$ git commit -a -m "assignment 0"
(You can also add any auxiliary files such as configuration/build files,
if you have any).
