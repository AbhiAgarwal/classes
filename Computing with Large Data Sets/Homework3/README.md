## Homework 3

#### Description of Homework

- The assignment is to tell me what is different and what is the same between these vectors: what can we learn about these events from these 4 x 3 vectors.
- Tell me what is different with three tables/plots or figures of your choice.
- If you want raw tweets you have to ask the guys and they can give you a small random sample from each topic+time.

#### Example questions:

1. what is different about the distribution of word frequencies ?
2. what are the most enriched or depleted words in each set
3. could you perform automated sentiment analysis of the word lists (by sampling words from this frequency) and estimate the change in sentiment by week.
(for example, are americans more worried about ebola or cops shooting their kids)
4. if you collect tweets today have the word count frequencies changed ?
5. can you identify dates and places separate from other words and determine relative frequencies of dates
6. fraction of words that are proper nouns or names change from event to event or by time?
