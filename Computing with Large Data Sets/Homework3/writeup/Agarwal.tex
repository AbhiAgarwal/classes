\section*{Three Tables}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first table I have created is to show sentiment analysis across all three datasets. Specifically I am looking at the sentiment analysis result that comes out when I'm using all the english words that are given, and comparing them to all the english words that are given provided they exist in the dictionary. 

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X|l|l|l|l}
\textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{2014-10-20} & \textbf{2014-10-27} & \textbf{2014-10-06} & \textbf{2014-10-13} \\
\hline Ebola with only english words & 0.00194 & 0.000158 & 0.00411 & 0.00120 \\ 
\hline Ebola with only dictionary words & 0.00999 & 0.000756 & 0.0202 & 0.00671 \\ 
\hline If They Gunned Me Down with only english words & -0.00201 & -0.0201 & -0.00333 & -0.00106 \\ 
\hline If They Gunned Me Down with only dictionary words & -0.00399 & -0.0398 & -0.00660 & -0.00211 \\ 
\hline US Top 10 Cities with only english words & 0.000135 & -0.0000689 & -0.000104 & 0.0000601 \\ 
\hline US Top 10 Cities with only dictionary words & 0.00162 & -0.000615 & -0.00111 & -0.000861 \\ 
\hline \end{tabularx}

\item The second table I concentrated on the most occurring words, and tried to give them some contextual information. I was trying to tag them depending on what they could mean. The first dataset I used was a dataset where all the letters of each word were english, and the second dataset was a dataset where all the english words were in the dictionary. The REFERENCE\#1 in the table points to the word emabiggestfansjustinbieber (LaTeX had lots of problems with me putting it into the table).

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X|l|l|l|l}
\textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{2014-10-20} & \textbf{2014-10-27} & \textbf{2014-10-06} & \textbf{2014-10-13} \\

\item The third table

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    x & y \\ \hline
    x & y \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{General}

\begin{enumerate}
\item I only filtered words that were in english - so I used a function to remove and normalize the datasets to only having english words.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Ebola dataset}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Ebola dataset contains 36,997 words, and 5,225 of the words are not english at all. Having removed the non-english words, the subset that remains has 25,122 words that are not in the dictionary. Therefore it leaves 6,650 unique words that exist in the english dataset. 
\item I only did sentiment analysis on words that were within the english language or words that I could have corrected using similarity matching. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{If They Gunned Me Down}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The If They Gunned Me Down dataset contains 7,911 words, and 794 of the words are not english at all. Having removed the non-english words, the subset that remains has 3,525 words that are not in the dictionary. Therefore it leaves 3,592 unique words that exist in the english dataset. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{US Top 10 Cities}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The If They Gunned Me Down dataset contains 111,771 words, and 30,299 of the words are not english at all. Having removed the non-english words, the subset that remains has 75,434 words that are not in the dictionary. Therefore it leaves 6,038 unique words that exist in the english dataset. 
\end{enumerate}
