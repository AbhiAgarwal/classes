I have done the Davis-Putnam algorithm, but didn't manage to finish either of the front-end and back-end completely due to time constraints.

I apologize for it. To run the Davis-Putnam algorithm run bash davis.sh, and to run the frontend run frontend.sh. The Davis-Putnam will fully work, but the frontend.sh won't. I only got the part where it takes the input and then parses it done.

Run:

davis.sh
frontend.sh

Thank you,
Abhi Agarwal
